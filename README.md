Apex Atlas generates large-scale, fully synthetic patient populations in FHIR-native format, grounded in public epidemiological data. It is built by [Parker](https://parkerapex.com) to support training healthcare AI models, validating FHIR integrations, populating demo environments, quality-measure testing, and shared data infrastructure across the APEX platform.

Every synthetic patient receives a Parker Global Patient Identifier (GPX) under the synthetic prefix namespace, making Atlas-generated data fully interoperable with the broader APEX ecosystem while remaining clearly distinguishable from production clinical data.

> **Why did Parker build this?** See [`docs/why-atlas.md`](./docs/why-atlas.md) for the full rationale — the problem with existing tools, the design decisions that set Atlas apart, and where it fits in the Parker mission.

## What sets Apex Atlas apart

Existing synthetic patient generators share a common set of limitations: disease module libraries that plateau in the dozens, clinical notes that read as obviously templated, and social determinants of health treated as metadata rather than causal variables. Apex Atlas addresses all three — and adds capabilities no other open generator offers:

- **SDoH as a causal simulation variable** — food insecurity, housing instability, transportation barriers, financial strain, and social isolation are sampled from BRFSS-grounded distributions and causally reduce outpatient encounter completion and medication adherence rates. Patients with barriers miss appointments and don't fill prescriptions — not as a tag, but as a change in what resources get generated.
- **Quality MeasureReport output** — Apex Atlas is the only open generator that emits DEQM-profiled MeasureReport resources alongside patient records. Five HEDIS-analog measures (HbA1c testing in diabetics, BP control in hypertensives, preventive care, flu immunization, pediatric well-child) are evaluated per patient and summarized for the cohort.
- **Full lifecycle coverage** — pediatric well-child visits with the ACIP 2024 immunization schedule, maternal health and obstetric complications, and 100 clinical modules spanning 14 domains (cardiovascular, metabolic, pulmonary, GI, renal/urology, musculoskeletal/rheumatology, mental health, substance use, neurology, oncology/hematology, infectious disease, pediatric/OB/prevention, dermatology/allergy, and ENT/ophthalmology).
- **Grounded clinical notes** — progress notes, H&Ps, and discharge summaries generated with structured-data grounding. LLM-authored notes (Claude, configurable) are available today via `--notes-strategy llm`.
- **Statistical validation against public norms** — every module declares its prevalence sources (NHANES, CDC, SEER, AHA) and the cohort fidelity harness checks aggregate distributions against those targets.
- **FHIR-first, always** — R4 and R5 output, US Core 6.1 conformance, FHIR Bulk Data Access-compatible NDJSON, Gravity Project SDOHCC Observations, and DEQM MeasureReport profiles.

## What Apex Atlas is not

Apex Atlas is not trained on, derived from, or in any way informed by restricted datasets such as MIMIC, UK Biobank, or similar credentialed sources. The generator is built exclusively from public, license-clean statistical distributions published by the CDC, NIH, AHA, and ACOG. No synthetic patient in Atlas corresponds to any real person.

## Launch Library

Apex Atlas currently ships **100 bundled modules** across 14 clinical domains. Every module carries public-source citations and representative FHIR emits; high-priority GTM modules are backed by sourced fidelity expectations and can be checked together with `atlas validate --gtm`.

The launch library is deliberately balanced across GTM use cases:

| Track | Modules | Why it matters |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Chronic disease and cardiometabolic care | 20 | Primary-care panels, care management, risk adjustment |
| Pulmonary, GI, renal, and MSK | 29 | Specialty workflows and high-volume outpatient testing |
| Mental health, SUD, and neurology | 16 | Whole-person care, utilization variance, longitudinal complexity |
| Oncology, hematology, and infectious disease | 14 | Specialty demos, procedures, diagnostics, staging, survivorship |
| Pediatric, OB, prevention, and immunizations | 12 | Full lifecycle coverage and payer quality programs |
| Dermatology, allergy, ENT, and ophthalmology | 9 | Common ambulatory use cases that make demos feel complete |

Module growth is not just a count. A module is v1-ready when it has public-source citations, deterministic smoke tests, representative FHIR emits, cohort fidelity expectations where prevalence is clinically material, and a documented review status.

See [`docs/module-catalog.md`](./docs/module-catalog.md) for the current module catalog, [`docs/roadmap.md`](./docs/roadmap.md) for the launch-readiness plan, and [`docs/gtm.md`](./docs/gtm.md) for the prime-time checklist.

    --module hypertension,diabetes \
    --with-sdoh --summary --out ./sdoh-cohort
```

### Quality measures

```bash
# Emit DEQM MeasureReport resources per patient + population summaries.
# Measures: DM HbA1c testing, HTN BP control, preventive care,
# flu immunization, pediatric well-child visits.
atlas generate --patients 1000 --seed 42 \
    --module hypertension,diabetes,wellness,pediatric_wellness \

# Columnar Parquet for analytics / DataFrame pipelines
pip install -e ".[data]"
atlas generate --patients 500 --seed 42 \
    --module hypertension --format parquet --out ./parquet
# generation-metadata.json is written into every output directory for audit and cohort tracking
```

### Generation metadata

Every `atlas generate` run writes a `generation-metadata.json` file into the output directory. This artifact is a run manifest, not a FHIR resource. It captures synthetic patient count, active modules / illness types, output format, feature flags, and cohort-level audit breadcrumbs for governance and marketing. `atlas validate` ignores this manifest during FHIR structural validation.

Example fields:

- `cohort_id`: generated run identifier
- `generated_at`: UTC timestamp when the cohort was produced
- `output_path`: target output directory
- `requested_patients`: requested synthetic patient count
- `actual_patients`: actual synthetic patient count produced
- `module_names`: list of active clinical modules
- `format`: output format (`fhir-r4`, `ndjson`, `parquet`)
- `profile`: FHIR profile used
- `seed`: RNG seed
- `with_notes`, `with_coverage`, `with_providers`, `with_claims`, `with_sdoh`, `with_measures`: enabled feature flags
- `summary`: optional demographic counts when `--summary` is used

This file makes cohort generation auditable and easy to aggregate over time.

### LLM-authored clinical notes

```bash
# Template-based notes (no API key required)
atlas generate --patients 50 --seed 42 \
    --module hypertension --with-notes --out ./notes-template

# Claude-authored narrative notes (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
atlas generate --patients 50 --seed 42 \
    --module hypertension \
    --with-notes --notes-strategy llm \
    --out ./notes-llm
```

### Cohort fidelity validation

```bash
# Check that a cohort's prevalence matches CDC/NHANES published rates
atlas generate --patients 20000 --seed 42 --module hypertension --out ./cohort
atlas validate ./cohort --cohort --module hypertension

# HTML report with demographics + fidelity bars (no JS, safe to email)
atlas report ./cohort --module hypertension --out cohort-report.html
# generation-metadata.json captured at generation time provides an audit trail for internal governance
```
